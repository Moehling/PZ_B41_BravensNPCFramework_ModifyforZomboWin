# PZ_B41_BravensNPCFramework_ModifyforZomboWin
In order to enjoy the zombie defeat mod, I pondered for a while and started modifying it.
Firstly, I am very sorry that I made modifications directly to the source file of BitBraven instead of creating a new mod for extension. 
Because initially I didn't want to make mods, I just wanted to modify them and use them for myself
But when I released a simple video, I found that there were still people who liked it. 
But it's already too late, I've made a lot of modifications, and I dare not take the time to break them down.
